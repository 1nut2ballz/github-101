##Hello, world!

My name is Anupama and my favorite animal is Kermit the Frog.

##My Thoughts on Government

My favorite government agency is the IRS and I love it because it's where I shop for roads, schools, and food stamps for people who need them.

My least favorite government agency is the FDA and I'd fix it by focusing more on nutrition and non-western and preventive foods and drugs.
